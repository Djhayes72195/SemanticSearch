The goal of this notebook is convert it into the format our app expects: a set of markdown files containing the wikipedia excerpts and a json dedicated to the question/answer pairs. Currently the test runner is only configured to handle queries where an answer is available, so we will initially focus on QA pairs where an answer is available. We will handle the cases where no answer is available at a later date."
