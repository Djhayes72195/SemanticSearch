        "This is a super simple semantic search example I threw together.\n",

        "Here is the idea:\n",
        " - We have some text we want to search for the answer to some query.\n",
        " - We split the text into subsections (see notes below regarding how we ought to do that).\n",
        " - We generate embeddings for the query and each subset of the text.\n",
        " - We then calculate cosine similarity between the\n",
        " query embeddings and each subsection embedding. The highest cosine similarity is (hopefully) the subset we are looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        " For this dummy example I chose a text generated by GPT and a query \"What challeneges are facing machine learning?\". Luckily it works out - we do return the answer we are looking for: \"Despite its success, machine learning faces challenges such as data privacy, bias, and explainability.\"\n",
        "\n",
        " Here are some of the challenges I am seeing:\n",
        " - It might be difficult to decide how to best divide the text into subsections. I have implemented three methods so far:\n",
        "  - Sentence by sentence.\n",
        "  - Rolling multi-sentence window.\n",
        "  - Using another model to divide the text based on continuation of logical ideas.\n",
        "Each of these methods assumes that the author of the document is using punctuation. If the document was a bulleted list or something, or the author used periods in a weird way, these methods will struggle. Using another model to find useful subsections for us seems like a nice idea, but it will be computationally expensive to implement and we would have to do the work of training a second model or tracking down a good one.\n",
        "\n",
        "- I don't know how well this will scale, or what it will take to scale it. I think it would be nice if I could query my whole vault at once, but this method would involve calculating cosine similarity between my query and every subset of every file in my whole vault. If we could find a way to rule out whole documents without processing the them every time in the way we are describing here, that would be nice. Or maybe the plugin just works on one document at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is some good news: I looked at the existing plugin for semantic search in Obsidian, and it requires an OpenAI API key -> it's pay to use. A non pay-to-use plugin would be great."
