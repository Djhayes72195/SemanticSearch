- **Key Features:**
    
    - Chromatids, now individual chromosomes, arrive at opposite poles of the cell.
    - Chromosomes begin to decondense into less compact chromatin, making them less visible under a microscope.
    - The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, creating two distinct nuclei.
    - The spindle apparatus disassembles, and the cell prepares for division of the cytoplasm.
- **Importance:**  
    Telophase restores the nuclear environment in each daughter cell, signaling the end of nuclear division.
