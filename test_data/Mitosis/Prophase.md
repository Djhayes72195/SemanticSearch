- **Key Features:**
    
    - Chromosomes condense into visible structures, each consisting of two sister chromatids connected at a centromere.
    - The nucleolus (responsible for ribosome production) disappears, signifying the start of mitotic activity.
    - Centrosomes (microtubule-organizing centers) begin to move to opposite poles of the cell, organizing the formation of the mitotic spindle.
    - The spindle fibers, composed of microtubules, start to extend outward.
- **Importance:**  
    Prophase sets the stage for chromosome alignment and ensures the machinery for chromosome segregation is established.
