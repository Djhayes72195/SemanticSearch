- **Key Features:**
    
    - Chromosomes are fully condensed and align at the metaphase plate (a plane equidistant from the two spindle poles).
    - Each sister chromatid is attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles via its kinetochore.
    - The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures all chromosomes are correctly attached to spindle fibers and aligned at the metaphase plate.
- **Importance:**  
    This stage ensures that sister chromatids are evenly distributed to the two daughter cells, preventing errors like aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number).
