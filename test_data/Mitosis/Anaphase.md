- **Key Features:**
    
    - Cohesin proteins holding sister chromatids together are cleaved by the enzyme separase, allowing chromatids to separate.
    - Sister chromatids are pulled toward opposite poles of the cell by shortening kinetochore microtubules.
    - Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate, pushing the poles further apart and elongating the cell.
- **Importance:**  
    Anaphase ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes by separating the sister chromatids accurately.
