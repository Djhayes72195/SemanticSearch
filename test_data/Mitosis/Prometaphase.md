- **Key Features:**
    
    - The nuclear envelope breaks down, allowing spindle fibers to access the chromosomes.
    - Kinetochores, protein structures at the centromeres of each chromosome, form and act as attachment points for spindle microtubules.
    - Some microtubules attach to kinetochores, forming kinetochore microtubules, while others interact with microtubules from the opposite pole, stabilizing the spindle.
    - Chromosomes begin to move toward the center of the cell but are not yet fully aligned.
- **Importance:**  
    Prometaphase ensures the spindle fibers can capture and maneuver the chromosomes, preparing for their proper alignment.
