Climate change poses significant challenges to global agriculture, affecting crop yields, soil health, and water availability. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns lead to increased frequency of droughts, floods, and heatwaves, disrupting traditional farming practices. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable, lacking resources to adapt to these changes. Innovations such as climate-resilient crops, precision agriculture, and sustainable farming practices offer potential solutions. Collaborative efforts between governments, researchers, and farmers are essential to ensure food security in a warming world.
