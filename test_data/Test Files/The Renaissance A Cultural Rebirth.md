The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, marked a period of profound cultural, artistic, and intellectual growth in Europe. Originating in Italy, it celebrated a revival of classical antiquity, emphasizing humanism, science, and the arts. Iconic figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo made groundbreaking contributions during this era. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg accelerated the dissemination of knowledge, fostering a spirit of inquiry and innovation. The Renaissance not only reshaped European society but also laid the groundwork for the modern age.
